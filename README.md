# DBF Developer Challenge - Overview

The DBF Developer Challenge is a coding challenge for applicants to web developer positions at the Department of Banking and Finance, University of Zurich. We think that it is fairer and more realistic to judge the capabilities of applicants with a small task, rather than asking theoretical questions about technical topics.

If you seek more information about us and what we work on at the DBF, check out <https://uzh-bf.github.io/joinus/>!

## Application process

When you apply for a job at our department, you will:

1. Solve [Challenge Part 1](task_1.md): Create a small React app to show your technical abilities :robot:
2. Solve [Challenge Part 2](task_2.md): Answer 3 practically-oriented questions to prove your knowledge :pencil2:
3. Send us the results of your challenge for a quick evaluation :outbox_tray:

Everybody that completes the challenge with a good standard (it does not have to be perfect) gets invited to a job interview. The challenge allows us to focus more on alignment of interests and your cultural fit rather than asking you a lot of technical questions :bell: However, we will most certainly talk to you about the challenge and your responses.

## Challenge Part 1: Web Development with React

For the first part of the challenge, you will need to create a **small React application** with basic Kanban board capabilities (think of Trello). By solving this challenge, you demonstrate that:

- You can work with `git` and apply version control in your workflow.
  - You commit your work regularly and in clear increments.
- You know the most important principles of Web Development.
- You can work with React and other JavaScript libraries.
- You write understandable and extendable code (i.e., high-quality).
  - Your code is readable and well-structured.
  - You write efficient and simple code and apply programming patterns and abstractions where sensible.

Details and user stories can be found in [task_1](task_1.md). This task should take you about 1 hour to complete.

## Challenge Part 2: Quiz

In the second part of the challenge, we ask you to select and answer **3 out of 5** questions. With your responses, you demonstrate that:

- You have relevant practical knowledge about web development and computer science.
- You can understand the structure of a web app and use an IDE to support you.
- You can evaluate and form your own opinion about a technology/framework.

Details and questions can be found in [task_2](task_2.md). This task should take you about 20 minutes to complete.
